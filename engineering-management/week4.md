# Software Defined Network - SDN

The Software Defined Network (SDN) is a technology that separate network control from network infrastructure and enable more automated management of network resources. The SDN is the solution itself, the application to manage the network, and it runs over a technology that makes it works. One of these technologies is the OpenFlow protocol, that link that allow the communication between the SDN controllers and the network devices.

## OpenFlow

OpenFlow is one of the first SDN standars and started the network software revolution. It defines a programmable network protocol to manage and direct traffic. The idea behing this approach separate programming of routers and switches from underlying hardware. The OpenFlow is separated in three main parts:

- Tables - tables are set up on switches.
- Controller - define the commands and talk to the switches devices.
- Protocol - the 'language' used by the controll to communicate with switches.

## Benefits and Chalenges

The SDN has been growing a lot and because this, the network area is moving in a new wave of new applications. 

That technology can bring a lot of benefits. In common network configurations, switches only known about their neighborings netowork. But SDN comes to allow the central control of everything in the netwok which makes easy to change things in the network and simplify the configuration and automation across the entreprise. These benefits can be reached in several topics like security controll, configurations, application tracking, data and etc. 

On the other hand, the SDN also bring some challenges. It is a very new concept and, compared with other technologies, the discussion about it in the internet or articles are just starting, which means that we can have difficult to find some very specific concepts, if necessary. It also require the training or hiring of employees to take care of this technology. About the technology itself, it can be a Single Point of Failure (SPOF), and is neessary to think about not only one but multiples controllers to avoid this problem. Finally, about CAPEX and OPEX, it can become a advantage by the truth, cause it simplify the manner to lead with the network and after the initial expedures with traning, hiring and configurations, the maintenance itself is better than for classical networks. 

Summaring, the SDN can be an excellent tool to evolve our Network Admnistration and Controll, but it is a challenge to us to use it and we need to define a good strategy to avoid problems halfway in its implantation.
